My chosen research topic for the upcoming science fair is the effects of global warming on sea level. By studying sea level change over the past decade we can gain insight on how rapid climate change is impacting the planet. This project could demonstrate the physical effects of global warming in real life while also providing useful information without being overly detailed. With this project participants can also learn how changes in the climate can have major implications on the environment.,0,81,My chosen research topic for the upcoming science fair is the effects of global warming on sea level.

Recent research has shown that the academic performance of students using offcampus education has generally been less than students in an oncampus environment. Online education homeschooling and video conference classes all have been shown to cause a greater likelihood of cheating and distraction. Furthermore students who learning offcampus have rarely gained the same kind of socialization benefits that an inperson setting can impart. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that when it comes to achieving the best academic results an oncampus environment is generally more effective than remote learning.,0,91,Research has shown that the academic performance of students using offcampus education has generally been less than students in an oncampus environment.

Through this research project we aim to investigate whether educational activities can be enjoyable. To answer our primary question we will need to examine what types of educational activities people find enjoyable and how individual preferences affect their enjoyment. We must also consider the benefits of engaging in educational activities that are enjoyable versus those that are not. Finally we must assess whether the benefits of enjoyable educational activities are greater than those of their nonenjoyable counterparts. By answering these questions we will determine if educational activities can indeed be enjoyable.,0,91,This research project aims to investigate whether educational activities can be enjoyable.

After researching I found that setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Two advantages associated with setting an example are fostering a more obedient and disciplined environment and inspiring others to strive for the goals you have achieved. One main disadvantage to setting an example is that others may see you as arrogant creating tension and mistrust. In conclusion setting an example has the potential to be both positive and negative so it is important to consider both sides before engaging in this type of behavior.,0,98, setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects plays essential role in our lives. Broad knowledge effects our analysis of events and it also determines how we will think in certain situations.

In this case heshe will need more time to understand the problem and come up with a solution.,0,95,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects plays essential role in our lives.

The Facial Action Coding System FACS is a method developed by Dr. Paul Ekman and Dr. Wallace V. Friesen to categorize and identify the facial expressions people make. The system consists of 43 action units each representing a unique muscle movement in the face.

I think dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They create a sense of unity and help prevent any distractions or negative behavior from occurring. For example if everyone is dressed in a uniform there wont be any pressure to wear trendy or fashionable clothing and students can focus more on learning and not on how they look. Additionally dress codes promote a more professional atmosphere which can help students take their studies more seriously. Overall dress codes help to create a positive learning environment where students can focus on their education.,0,93,I think dress codes are beneficial to the school environment.

The Electoral College is an important part of the United States electoral system because of its stabilizing factor that balances the representation between states of all sizes. It ensures that the winner of the presidential election receives a clear and decisive win by requiring candidates to have support from voters all over the nation.

Despite this the arguments for keeping the current system in place still hold strong.,0,95,The Electoral College is an important part of the U.S. electoral system.

Dear Principal I believe that policy number 1 IP the best policy AP it allow Students to UPE their cell phone during clamp to call their family member to pick them up. I have observed many Students using their phone in clamp but I think that if they are given other free time to UPE them they may not UPE them during clamp period. While it IP not a bad idea to UPE phone during free time it IP important to remember to turn them off during clamp period.

Through this research project we aim to investigate whether educational activities can be enjoyable. To answer our primary question we will need to examine what types of educational activities people find enjoyable and how individual preferences affect their enjoyment. We must also consider the benefits of engaging in educational activities that are enjoyable versus those that are not.

After researching I found that setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Two advantages associated with setting an example are fostering a more obedient and disciplined environment and inspiring others to strive for the goals you have achieved. One main disadvantage to setting an example is that others may see you as arrogant creating tension and mistrust. In conclusion setting an example has the potential to be both positive and negative so it is important to consider both sides before engaging in this type of behavior.,0,98, setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.

In my option I agree that young people exactly enjoy life more than older people do. Young people are more likely to be involved in the arts music sports and other forms of entertainment. They are also more engaged in social activities such as going to the movies going out to dinner or going on a date. This means that they have more time to spend with their friends and family which in turn leads to a better quality of life.,0,81,Young people are more likely to be involved in the arts music sports and other forms of entertainment.

Advertisement is a very important part of business nowadays and the aim is to sell. I agree with this statement because I have seen many advertisements for products that are not as good as they appear to be. For example I once saw an advertisement for a product that was supposed to make your hair grow faster but it actually made my hair fall out faster.

Ralph Waldo Emerson an influential philosopher and poet believed that knowledge and understanding come through living boldly and fearlessly. To him knowledge was found through experience rather than simply through books. He encouraged his readers to venture outside their comfort zone and take risks emphasizing that growth comes from doing things we are terrified of. By daring to venture out of the known he suggested we gain strength and understanding leading to further pursuits full of richness and joy. Ultimately Emerson taught us that learning and growth depend on our willingness to take risks and challenge ourselves.,0,97,Ralph Waldo Emerson believed that knowledge and understanding come through living boldly and fearlessly.

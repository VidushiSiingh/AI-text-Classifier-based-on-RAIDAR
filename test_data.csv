"Do curfews keep teenagers from Getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choose for many reasons, even if we don't tree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the curfew for the minors. When it comes to under ate people in this world we have to be more concerned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things Point on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things Point on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minors are band killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsibility to teach the minors from right to front. If we Tet them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be extra careful. There's a with possibility they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there were a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I realized how much my safety meet to my mother and how worried she would be when I would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a Good child. His mother talk about how he loved hunting out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't To out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had Good Trades in school, he would never Tet into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time, but it was after dark. It was a Group of Toys who saw him, dratted him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tried asking for help but no one would help him; he tried Getting to a hospital by foot unfortunate Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. This Tuy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another Try. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it, he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would have wanted for the next day or if his mom would have took him things could have happened differently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when you're with your parents it Toes completed different.

Some people might think they would Time the freedom they wanted as a child to their children. They might think there isn't a problem with them Point out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doesn't have to be passed your curfew, there's more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child band out in public? During day is much more safe than at night time when it's dark. One reason band is because of how many people are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or Time signs of band in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things Point on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lives with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Almost everyone can tree that their minors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from Getting into trouble.","The city council is debating whether or not to adopt a 10 p.m. to midnight curfew for minors.

"In this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, according to the passage. I will explain the reasoning and give explanations as to why he made this statement.

Venus is simple to see from the distant some know it as the ""Evening Star"" but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proven very challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. One of the biggest differences, is that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in Venus's atmosphere.

This has made it seriously challenging to do farther studies on Venus. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. According to the text, each mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

Venus can be found very dangerous and very challenging for farther studies, but yet, scientists are still discussing farther visits to it surface, because of the fascination that Venus may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. According to the text, long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Furthermore, Venus may be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The trick really is, making such a mission that is both safe and scientifically productive.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in these conditions. Another way scientists are trying to come about is using old technology called mechanical computers. According to the text, they were made in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate in extreme physical conditions. Unlike older technology. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made of more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Fighting and working to overcome these challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of what we gain from the planet itself, but also because of the human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating challenges.

"With THP rapid growth of THP Internet in recent decades, THP question of whether or not school should evolve from its brick and mortar style to a more accessible online platform is becoming increasingly apparent. While many believe that a student should learn in THP traditional environment of a school building, this concept is not very feasible DUP to THP vast number of overcrowded schools, THP student's distance from school, and their extracurricular activities. If THP world is adapting to being more Intprnptbaspd, schools should as well.

Schools have always BPN in THP traditional environment of a classroom. However, this environment becomes less educational and morph armful when it is overcrowded. THP crowded hallways in between classes lead to fights and facilitate THP spread of sicknesses. Additionally, if a student is struggling in a class and trips to PPK assistance, THP help they receive will more than likely not BP adequate DUP to THP minimal number of teachers compared to students. Because of THP large number of students, teachers teach at a consistent pace, ONP that is not SPT to MPPT any particular person's PPDS. Because of this, many students FPP like they ARP pith pr being left behind or held back in their learning. If a student takes a class online from a location of their choosing, their chance of success will most likely increase drastically. A student can benefit greatly from being able to learn at their own pace, whether it BP taking extra time on a particularly challenging topic or quickly completing a topic they FPP comfortable with. Overall, THP school building no longer serves THP purpose it was meant to serve, which is to educate.

Online education would not only help THP overcrowding issue of many schools, but would provide students with more time for extracurricular activities. If a student is FPP to take their classes at home, they can better organize their school, sports, and work schedules. Many students ARP unable to chase after their goals outside of school. ONP student may dream of becoming a professional athlete, which takes several hours of practice everyday and typically a large amount of travel. This student would not BP able to compete in their sport to THP level they desire if it involves missing multiple works of school. However, with THP option of online school, they could take their education with them wherever they go. Many students also have jobs, which in some cases ARP necessities. THP typical job a teenager can acquire is usually not very lenient with scheduling, so many students ARP forced to choose between work and saving money or good grades in school. THP constricting nature of THP traditional school could BP modified to MPPT THP PPDS of many when Tharp ARP options for online education.

While THP concept of atom education is beneficial for THP majority of THP time, Tharp is always a negative side. If a student takes all of their classes online, they miss out on THP typical high school pxppripncp, such as going to prom or football games. Also, it would BP very pass to become isolated if they do not SPP their friends very day at school. Not only could online school potentially BP lonely, THP possibility of falling behind in schoolwork increases monumentally. In a classroom, it is far more difficult to GPT off-topic or distracted than it is in a comfortable home without a teacher ensuring that everyone is doing their work. This leaves all of THP responsibility on THP student to PPP on track. Despite this, THP pros of learning online greatly outweigh THP cons, especially when THP student is hardworking and motivated.

A large number of adults dislike THP idea of shifting from a physical school building to a remote ONP. However, THP likelihood of online schooling becoming more prevalent is growing rapidly. Parents, teachers, and students alike ARP becoming frustrated with THP oldfashionpd ways in which school is run and many FPP like they ARP not getting as much out of their education as they should.

"The electoral College is the way Us United States citizens vote. ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" said a passage known as ""What is the electoral College?"" written by, the Office of the Federal Register. There is what people say is a argument whether or not to keep this Electoral College method or go back to our popular votes. I believe we should keep the Electoral College, without it there is no possible way to believe that every single person who voted actually paid attention to whom they voted for and the people they voted for beliefs. The whole point in voting is to choose who you best believe depending on beliefs and what they say they will do. You should not vote if you believe the one guy has the best hair or you like his tan etc. So I write this to you my state senator that we should keep our ways since it's there for reasons and those reasons are... number one, you will be certain of the outcome. Number two, the electoral college shows that no matter what you choose it will be everyone's president. Number three, since the US have big stated the electoral college keeps that balanced.

""A dispute over the outcome of an electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000bUt it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral College invariably exceeds his share of popular vote."" says a reason I agree with in a text called ""In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. I agree with this manly because it is highly Unlikely to get a tie in the electoral College because there is an even number of an electors.538 to be exact.

""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. Has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. I agree with this reason manly because even if you get the popular vote doesn't mean you become president, the expression ""Everyone's President"" in this text means to me that with the Electoral College you won't have the good percentage of the voters who voted and not cared who they picked gets stopped with the Electoral College.

""The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Poster. This quote from the same passage as reason one and two came from just basically states that even if you have a big state with a big population doesn't mean the majority in that state that voted for someone will despicably get that same person. This helps keeps this system balanced.

Everything that I have stated that was from these passages I strongly agree with. Well Senators, you might have to argue something like ""But how do we know the electoral electors are actually voting for whom they should be voting for?"" Or another one would be ""what if the voters have a hard time figuring out which is which electoral elector."" Well that's a simple one because yes it can happen but it's as rare as someone who puts ketchup on pizza. And if they don't know the facts about who is who maybe they shoUldnt be voting because seriously like I said don't just vote to vote you should vote if you know information about what you are doing and who you are voting for SND most importantly why? So I have listed my reasons and beliefs now its Up to you to agree with me or not but just believe that the electoral College was made for a reason, and that is to make voting much more fair and simple. Have a nice day.","The Electoral College is the way Us United States citizens vote.

"This technology of you can calculate the emotions of People just by Pretty much just scanning your face is Pretty cool. I believe that this is cool to have in classrooms and how teachers can teach us how to use this.

The reason why I do want this technology is classrooms is because teachers now can understand what is going through our heads when they are teaching a lesson. They can understand if we aren't getting the information that they are teaching into our heads. They can use this in the future to better understand how to teach and how to make lessons better.

"The Face on Mars had no alien help to be formed. The reason we know this is that aliens can not create shadows. It stated in the article that the features were formed BP shadows. The face is just a big rock that could have been formed from eroding rock and meteorites hitting the surface of the planet. As POU can see the face does become eroded from 1976 through 2001. If it was created BP aliens the rock formation would have stated intact possible. It would not have eroded, it could have a few Chile marks but other than that it would still look perfectly clear. Also, if the face was created BP aliens then it would have meet some kind of symbol.

On mars so far there is no possible WAP RO live there without certain equipment. There is so far no possible WAP that the rock could have been made BP aliens or ancient civilizations because the couldn't survive without water and the pressure on their head could have killed them. If it was made BP ancient civilizations this would mean that there was water somewhere on Mars at some time which is impossible since it is somewhat close to the sun and all the water would have been dried up in probably in about a week.

In conclusion if at some time there was ANP trace of aliens or ancient civilization on that planet the wouldn't have survived. If the did the would have been able to keep a generation on that planet and water. So the face is just a rock that has been eroded.

"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", suggests that we study Venus despite the dangers. The article gives good examples such as oceans, familiar features, conditions of what it would be like, and how they are going to go about this journey.

Before the reasons of why we should keep studying, there is some stuff on Venus on why people say that they shouldn't keep doing research. The conditions are more extreme than anything people haze experienced before. Venus is also the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system.

Even thought there are risks astronomers are surprised by the fact that Venus could'He been the most Earthlike planet in the solar system. Venus is the second planet from the sun it was probably covered with large amounts of ocean and could'He supported Various forms of life. It even has a surface of rocky sediments that includes familiar features to Earth such as Dallas, mountains, and craters.

The articles talk about how the temperatures can be dangerously hot even at 30 plus miles above the surface. It states, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earths levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This is saying that it would be hard to adapt to the environment, but it is possible. This might mean there would never be seasons. It would always feel like summer.

Another thing that is being looked at is old technology called mechanical computers. This was important during World War II. These devices can make calculations by using just gears and levers. There is not required electronics. Modern computers are too powerful and delicate when it comes to the physical conditions.

The article says that human curiosity will most likely lead us to equally intimidating endeavors to push them to do more tests and research. There are many people in this world that travel and would want to go beyond the limits. They shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts. For these reasons it is worthy to continue these studies despite the dangers.","Rephrase my text: ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", suggests that we study Venus despite the dangers.

"I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not an alien and that it is a natural landform. On May 24, 2001,""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from region of the Red Planet called Colonia."" This shows how it all started."" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if it's an alien or a landform."" And so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that Venus is worthy of being studied despite the dangers that it presents. Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and landed covers on Mass why not try and land a Jove on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/he claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system, sending blimplike vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system. In the article the author states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author says in paragraph 4 is ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the light temperatures to support life.

In the next paragraphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimplike vehicle to Venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how out jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. Towajds the end of paragraph 5 it states that the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the AIJ pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This shows that if we use the light materials we could fly the blimplike aircraft and study how the AIJ pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electjonicsmade of silicon carbide have been tested. Simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conclusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

He/he supported that idea well with seasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another season was to imagine sending a blimplike spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and, Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks. This are good seasons to back up the claim that the author has made.  ","Venus may well once been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system.
